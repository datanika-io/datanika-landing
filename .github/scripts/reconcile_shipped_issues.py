"""Label every OPEN issue whose work is already deployed to production (core#773).

Ported from `datanika-core` 2026-09-02. The behaviour is deliberately identical; only the
repository vocabulary differs, and every difference is pinned by
`tests/reconcile-shipped-guard.test.ts`. Read that file before editing this one -- the
precedent it follows is `promotion-refs-guard.test.ts`, written after core's fix for
landing#315 lived in core alone for all seven of this repo's generated promotion blocks.

Three values change on the way across, and each is silent when wrong:

    core                          landing
    ----                          -------
    PROD_REF default `master`     `main`
    FOREIGN strips landing|cloud  strips core|cloud       <- inverted, not extended
    local prefix `core#N`         `landing#N`

Why landing needed it at all: this repo's promotion of 2026-09-02 shipped five issues
(#443, #403, #396, #435, #446) that are still open, and nothing surfaced them. Core has had
the reconciler since 2026-08-31 and has surfaced 62 issues; landing had only
`promotion-pr-refs.yml`, which reads closing keywords and therefore generated a completely
empty block on the 2026-08-31 landing promotion while the workflow reported success.

Why this exists
---------------
`promotion_refs.py` turns closing keywords in the promoted commits into `Closes #N` on the
promotion PR, so merging it closes those issues. That covers only the commits that used a
**closing** keyword. Almost every commit in this project writes `refs #N`, which closes
nothing -- deliberately, because WORKFLOW_RULES section 4 records a real incident where
`closes #272` on a 4-of-36 partial fix retired the whole issue.

Measured on the 2026-08-31 promotion: 28 commits, roughly twelve issues shipped, exactly
**two** closing references generated. A repo-wide sweep the same night found **26** open
issues whose implementing commit was already an ancestor of the deployed `master` -- twelve
more than the promotion range alone revealed, including two that two departments had each
independently re-derived as open work.

So the gap is not the keyword discipline and must not be closed by linting commit messages.
The gap is that nothing reconciles the tracker against production **at the moment the
difference becomes true**.

What this does, and what it deliberately does not
-------------------------------------------------
It answers one mechanical question per open issue: *is a commit that references this issue
already an ancestor of the deployed production ref?* If yes, it applies the `shipped-to-prod`
label and names the issue in one summary comment on the promotion PR.

**It never closes anything.** Closing needs someone who knows whether the acceptance criteria
are fully met, and `refs` exists precisely because that is often "no". The label converts a
silent, invisible condition into a queryable one::

    gh issue list --repo <repo> --state open --label shipped-to-prod

An open issue *without* the label is genuinely not in production. An open issue *with* it is
shipped and unreconciled. That distinction is the whole product; before it, an issue's open
state carried no information at all.

The label is applied once and never removed, so each run's comment lists only what is *newly*
detected. The label is the memory; the comment is the delta.

Failing loudly
--------------
The landing promotion the same night generated an **empty** references block and the workflow
still reported `success`, which is indistinguishable from it never having run. This script
therefore treats "I found nothing to look at" as an error, not as a clean result: zero commits
scanned, zero references extracted, or zero open issues fetched all exit non-zero.
