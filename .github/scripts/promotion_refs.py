"""Populate a promotion PR body with the `Closes #N` refs of the commits it promotes.

GitHub fires closing keywords only for PRs merged into the DEFAULT branch. Feature PRs
here merge into `dev`, so their own `Closes #N` never fires; the issue is closed only if
the promotion PR (dev -> main) carries the reference. WORKFLOW_RULES §8 makes that a
manual enumeration step, which is why issues leak.

References are gathered from two places, because neither alone is reliable:
  1. the commit messages being promoted -- our convention puts `(closes #N)` there, but
     not every commit follows it;
  2. the pull requests those commits came from -- the PR title/body almost always has it,
     and survives a rebase-merge that rewrote the commit message.

Idempotent: rewrites a single marked block, so repeated runs (synchronize events) never
duplicate. Never closes anything itself -- merging the promotion PR does that.

    """Did this PR actually bring the commit in, or does its branch merely contain it?

    `GET /repos/{repo}/commits/{sha}/pulls` returns **every** pull whose branch contains
    the commit -- not just the one that introduced it. Any open feature branch cut from
    `dev` therefore comes back for every commit already on `dev`, and without this filter
    it donates its closing keywords to the promotion.

    That is datanika-core#635, caught on core's promotion PR #634 before merge: the block
    claimed `Closes #608 ... via #633` while #633 was still open and one commit ahead of
    `dev`. It was fixed in core#636 and **this repo was never patched** (landing#315), so
    the buggy version ran on all 7 of landing's generated blocks. Audited 2026-08-30
    across both repos -- 29 promotions, 83 issue references, one real false closure
    (core#425, closed by core's promotion #469 crediting #467, which merged 12 minutes
    later). Landing's own 7 were clean, but by luck: the bug only fires when an open
    branch carries a closing keyword at promotion time, and landing's usual pattern is
    Growth-merges-then-Infra-promotes with zero open PRs.

    Direction is why this is worth fixing on a clean record. The automation replaced
    hand-enumeration, which failed **open**; this bug makes it fail **closed**, which is
    worse -- an open issue gets re-triaged by whoever reads the board next, a wrongly
    closed one does not.

    Two independent reasons to skip, and neither subsumes the other:
      * not merged -> the branch merely contains the commit
      * base main  -> a previous promotion PR, which IS merged

    ⚠️ `"main"`, not `"master"`. Core's copy of this function filters on `master` because
    that is core's default branch. Porting it verbatim would make this repo skip nothing
    and re-list every earlier promotion PR's references.
